# Pi

**Welcome to Pi!**

> Pi is an app created by students for the students. It carries a huge library of formulas that are there for when you need them. Pi can help you solve your homework in just a fraction of your average time. About to take a test? Study all formulas from your phone and ace that test! Not a student? Pi also contains a section called "Everyday Math"!

## Introduction
So I'm 15 years old, I created this app 3 months ago in ***Ionic & Angular.js***. I noticed Ionic had some performance issues & it just wasn't fit for my app. Well now I'm creating version 2.0 of **Pi**, & it's completely native in **Swift 3**, **Objective-C** & **Java**.

## Why did I make this?
My main focus for this app is to ***actually help*** students go through school without feeling pressured with tests, homework, etc. I feel like **Pi** can become super big on the market & it would really be a perfect tool for students. I want to change how students perceive school.

## What can you do with this?
A lot of things, contribute, get ideas, fork this & make your own version, anything!
