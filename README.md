# Pi

**Welcome to Pi!**

> Pi is an app created by students for the students. It carries a huge library of formulas that are there for when you need them. Pi can help you solve your homework in just a fraction of your average time. About to take a test? Study all formulas from your phone and ace that test! Not a student? Pi also contains a section called "Everyday Math"

## Introduction
So I'm 15 years old, I created this app 3 months ago in ***Ionic & Angular.js***. I noticed Ionic had some performance issues & it just wasn't fit for my app. Well now I'm creating version 2.0 of **Pi**, & it's completely native in **Swift 3** & **Objective-C**.

## Why did I make this?
Mmm, well originally I did this to piss off some kid I didn't like, I knew mine would be better than his. But that phase is over now, I have nothing against him anymore.

Now my main focus for this app is to ***actually help*** students go through school without feeling pressured with tests, homework, etc. I feel like **Pi** can become super big on the market & it would really be a perfect tool for students. I want to change how students perceive school.

## Contribution
The main reason for me open-sourcing this project is to actually grow this into something big. I can't do that all by myself. Even the best developers need a helping hand. So ***please***, contribute. ***This will*** be something big. I see an amazing future for this.

## Disclaimers
 - Please don't take this & publish it for yourself, I will sue you. I promise.
 - Don't take credit for any of this because again, I will sue you.
