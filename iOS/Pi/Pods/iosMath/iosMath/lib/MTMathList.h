/** A `MTMathAtom` is the basic unit of a math list. Each atom represents a single character
 or mathematical operator in a list. However certain atoms can represent more complex structures
 such as fractions and radicals. Each atom has a type which determines how the atom is rendered and
 a nucleus. The nucleus contains the character(s) that need to be rendered. However the nucleus may
 be empty for certain types of atoms. An atom has an optional subscript or superscript which represents
 the subscript or superscript that is to be rendered.
 
 Certain types of atoms inherit from `MTMathAtom` and may have additional fields.
